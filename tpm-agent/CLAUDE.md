# File access
- You are strictly prohibited from modifying the README file of this project, unless I explicitly ask you to.
- You can only modify files under the "app" folder. You can only modify files in other directories if I explicitly ask you.
- You may look in the entirety of the repository for context. Never change anything outside of the "app" folder without explaining the need and asking for confirmation from me.

# Reply style
- Once you've implemented a change, do not explain it to me. I don't want additional text other than your code suggestions. If I need explanation, I will ask for it explicitly.
- Don't try to rebuild or run the project after each change. I will ask you explicitly if I need you to check that.

# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
