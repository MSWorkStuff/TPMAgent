Great! An MCP server for GitHub issue management is an excellent project. Before I create the comprehensive roadmap, I need to clarify some key technical details:

## Clarifying Questions

### MCP Server Specifics
1. **MCP Implementation**: Are you planning to use the official MCP TypeScript SDK, or do you have a preference for the implementation approach?
2. **Server Type**: Should this be a stdio-based MCP server, SSE server, or WebSocket server?

### GitHub Integration
3. **Authentication**: How do you want to handle GitHub authentication? (Personal Access Tokens, GitHub App, OAuth?)
4. **GitHub API**: Any preference between REST API v4 or GraphQL API v4?
5. **Scope**: Should this work with any GitHub repository the user has access to, or specific repositories?

### Issue Format & Data Structure
6. **Issue Format**: You mentioned you'll describe the format - could you share the specific format you want for defining issues in the initial prompt?
7. **Issue Fields**: Beyond title and description, what GitHub issue fields do you want to support? (labels, assignees, milestones, projects?)

### CLI Tool Requirements
8. **CLI Functionality**: Should the CLI tool be able to:
   - Start/stop the MCP server?
   - Send prompts directly to create issues?
   - Manage server configuration?
9. **Configuration**: How should users configure GitHub tokens, repository targets, etc.?

### Automation Scope
10. **Automation Level**: When you say "automate GitHub issue creation," do you mean:
    - Batch creation from a structured prompt?
    - Interactive issue creation with AI assistance?
    - Template-based issue generation?

Once I have these details, I'll create a roadmap that properly sequences the MCP server development, GitHub integration, CLI tooling, and automation features with clear incremental milestones.
