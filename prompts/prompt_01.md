## Providing more details for the LLM

Given the [previous result](./prompt_00_result.md), we are asked to provide more details. We responded in the following way:

```sh
1. Use the official SDK
2. SSE server
3. PAT
4. REST
5. Specific
6. The format is dependent on the GitHub library you use. Anything that Octokit supports well.
7. Labels (should also be generated) and milestones (assume a 2 week sprint) and they should all be assigned to the same project.
8. Scratch the CLI just use a configuration file (in YAML)
9. Use the YAML file mentioned above and a .env file where it makes sense
```
